Sprinting module for the kid size [ROBOTIS OP2 robot](http://en.robotis.com/index/product.php?cate_code=111310). 
The objective is for the robot to sprint within a given straight path towards a visual target. When the robot reaches a discernable close proximity to the target, it changes course by walking backwards, away from the target, maintaining the same path. 

This project uses OPENCV to process images captured in real time from the robot's camera. The purpose of this is for competitions like ROBOCUP and FIRA.
